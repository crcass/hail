# Hail to the Cheif!

## Game Start
	User can press any key to begin. 
	Answer key will automatically populate from the array, with _ replacing letters.
	Each letter pressed by the user will be checked against the answer and either replace _ in the answer key or push input to an array of unused letters.
	As the user guesses incorrect letters, the number of remaining guesses will reduce.

## Game End
	If the user correctly guesses all the correct letters before the remaining guesses = 0, a win screen will display and audio will play.
	If the user reduces the remaining letters to 0 before correctly guessing the answer, a defeat screen will display.

	In either case, pressing any key will reset the the game and increment the score depending on the win or loss condition.
